CO\u2082 clathrate hydrates can change this because CO\u2082 is trapped in crystalline water. The CO\u2082 flash-freezing process developed in this thesis forms CO\u2082 hydrates directly in a confection as it freezes. In this process, the confection mixture is dispersed in liquid CO\u2082; then the combined fluids are flashed to 10-20 bars. The mixture breaks up into small fragments, which rapidly crystallize into CO\u2082 hydrate (instead of ice) due to the intimate contact between mixture and evaporating CO\u2082 . This CO\u2082 hydrate formation results in a frozen, carbonated confection. CO\u2082 hydrates have a significant impact on packaging and storage requirements for the confection. This study shows that the minimum storage pressure is determined by the ice- CO\u2082 hydrate-gas equilibrium (IHG) curve, which does not change with the concentration of solutes in the aqueous phase. The minimum CO\u2082 content in a storage vessel is determined by the amount of CO\u2082 needed to avoid ice; in the presence of ice CO\u2082 can redistribute quickly, leading to an inhomogeneous product. Packaging must therefore be designed considering the significant CO\u2082 evolution from dissociating CO\u2082 hydrates during heat shock. Warming of a confection causes CO\u2082 hydrates to dissociate, even at pressures greater than the IHG pressure due to the requirement of chemical equilibrium between water in aqueous and crystalline phases. In packaging with limited heads pace, this CO\u2082 release increases the pressure significantly.(cont.) When CO\u2082 hydrate confections are consumed CO\u2082 is strongly perceived both through tingling caused by carbonic acid and through tactile stimulation caused by bubbles. A higher concentration of CO 2 is required in CO\u2082 hydrate confections than in carbonated beverages for similar fizziness perception because a significant fraction of the CO\u2082 escapes when a consumer exhales. The CO\u2082 concentration in the melted confection does not exceed the solubility of CO\u2082 at atmospheric pressure, but ingredients in the recipe can modulate the growth of bubbles as the confection melts. Consumer testing is needed to define the form and style of CO\u2082 hydrate confection that should be pursued.by Teresa Baker Peters.Thesis (Ph.
